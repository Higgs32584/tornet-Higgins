# TorNet: Residual Connections and 

Software to work with the TorNet dataset as described in the paper [*A Benchmark Dataset for Tornado Detection and Prediction using Full-Resolution Polarimetric Weather Radar Data*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16437)

## Updates (7/9/24)

* Both the  model is now available on [huggingface (tornet-ml/tornado_detector_baseline_v1)](https://huggingface.co/tornet-ml/tornado_detector_baseline_v1).   Instructions for downloading and using the pre-trained model can be found in `models/README.md` and in the `VisualizeSamples.ipynb` notebook.

## Downloading the Data

The TorNet dataset can be downloaded from the following location:

#### Zenodo


If downloading through your browser is slow, we recommend downloading these using `zenodo_get` (https://gitlab.com/dvolgyes/zenodo_get).

After downloading, there should be 11 files, `catalog.csv`, and 10 files named as `tornet_YYYY.tar.gz`.   Move and untar these into a target directory, which will be referenced using the `TORNET_ROOT` environment variable in the code.  After untarring the 10 files, this directory should contain `catalog.csv` along with sub-directories `train/` and `test/` filled with `.nc` files for each year in the dataset.


## Setup

Basic python requirements are listed in `requirements/basic.txt`.

The `tornet` package can then installed into your environment by running

`pip install .`

In this repo.  To do ML with TorNet, additional installs may be necessary depending on library of choice.  See e.g., `requirements/tensorflow.txt`, `requirements/torch.txt` and/or `requirements/jax.txt`.  

Please note that we did not exhaustively test all combinations of operating systems, data loaders, deep learning frameworks, and GPU usage.  If you are using the latest version of `keras`, then I recommend you follow setup instructions on the keras webpage [https://keras.io/getting_started/](https://keras.io/getting_started/).  Feel free to describe any issues you are having under the issues tab.  

### Conda

If using conda

```
conda create -n tornet-{backend} python=3.10
conda activate tornet-{backend}
pip install -r requirements/{backend}.txt
```

Replace {backend} with tensorflow, torch or jax.


## Loading and visualizing TorNet

Start with `notebooks/DataLoaders.ipynb` to get an overview on loading and visualizing the dataset.

To run inference on TorNet samples using a pretrained model,  look at `notebooks/VisualizeSamples.ipynb`.

## Train CNN baseline model

### Multiple backend support with Keras 3
The model uses Keras 3 which supports multiple backends. The environment variable
KERAS_BACKEND can be used to choose the backend. 

```
export KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
# export KERAS_BACKEND=torch
# export KERAS_BACKEND=jax
```

The following trains the CNN baseline model described in the paper using `tensorflow`.  If you run this out-of-the-box, it will run very slowly because it uses the basic dataloader.  Read the DataLoader notebook for tips on how to optimize the data loader.
```
# Set path to dataset
export TORNET_ROOT=/path/to/tornet     

# Run training
python scripts/tornado_detection/train_tornado_keras.py scripts/tornado_detection/config/params.json
```

## Evaluate trained model
To evaluate this model on the test set, run

```
# Set path to dataset
export TORNET_ROOT=/path/to/tornet  

# Evaluate trained model
python scripts/tornado_detection/test_tornado_keras.py 
```

This will compute and print various metrics computed on the test set.  Note that this script will attempt to download pretrained weights from huggingface, so ensure there is internet connectivity.  Alternatively, manually download the pretrained yourself and provide with `--model_path`
