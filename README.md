# üåÄ Tornado Prediction with Wide ResNet Ensembles

This contribution extends the [Tornet benchmark](https://github.com/mit-ll/tornet) with optimized deep learning architectures for tornado detection using polarimetric radar data. The focus is on enhancing performance via model refinement and ensembling, culminating in a lightweight and high-performing prediction pipeline.

## üìå Overview

This project:
- Develops multiple ResNet-style neural network variants optimized for the Tornet dataset.
- Integrates **CoordConv2D** to improve spatial awareness in convolutional layers.
- Uses **Precision-Recall AUC** and **Threat Score** as primary metrics to evaluate model performance, particularly for imbalanced classes.
- Introduces a streamlined **ensemble** of Wide ResNet variants that improves robustness and precision across tornado strength levels.

## üß† Key Contributions

### ‚úÖ Version 5 ‚Äì Lightweight Wide ResNet
- ~230k parameters.
- Excellent performance-to-size ratio.
- Pre-activation block design with dropout and early normalization.
- Tuned with Binary Cross-Entropy + Adam + Exponential Decay.

### ‚úÖ Version 6 ‚Äì Gated Wide ResNet
- ~514k parameters.
- Dynamically blends shallow vs. deep inference paths for "easy" and "hard" tornado cases.
- Introduces learned gating for adaptive computation.

### üîÄ Ensemble (v5 + v6)
- Simple average ensemble of model outputs.
- Achieves a **7-point PR-AUC increase** over the baseline.
- Provides robustness across EF0 to EF2+ tornadoes, reducing false alarms while preserving sensitivity.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

| Metric         | Description                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PR-AUC**     | Threshold-independent evaluation for class imbalance        |
| **F1 Score**   | Precision-recall tradeoff at a specific threshold           |
| **Threat Score (CSI)** | Prioritizes correctness in severe event prediction      |

Ensemble models consistently outperform the [baseline](https://huggingface.co/tornet-ml/tornado_detector_baseline_v1) on all major metrics.
