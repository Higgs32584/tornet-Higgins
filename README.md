# üåÄ Tornado Prediction with Wide ResNet Ensembles update 5-15-2025

This contribution extends the [Tornet benchmark](https://github.com/mit-ll/tornet) with optimized deep learning architectures for tornado detection using polarimetric radar data. The focus is on enhancing performance via model refinement and ensembling, culminating in a lightweight and high-performing prediction pipeline that utilizes wide_resnet with a gated mechanism, as well as an 85 percent reduction in memory

## üìå Overview (Update 5-15-2025)

This project
- Cosine decay with warmup also replaces Exponential Decay
- The five fold ensemble does do better on AUC and AUCPR but is slightly worse on other metrics
- Additionally, the best combo is technically fold1+fold5, but it is likely an unfair overfit ensemble that was overpeeking anyway, as we can't pick and choose the folds that go into an ensemble that would be cheating :)
- The ensemble of five may not justify its parameter count frankly, but overall still technically does better on AUC and AUCPR.
- I added a new script so that you can point to a folder, put in the threshold and it will calculate the test score off of that, so you don't have to put the path of every file in the CLI

### Increase in Performance Across Metrics(Relative to WRN+Gated ensemble)

| Metric             | Improvement |
|--------------------|-------------|
| AUC                | 0.54%       |
| AUCPR              | 2.59%       |
| Binary Accuracy    | 0.07%       |
| More True Positives | 57         |
| More False Positives| 33         |
|Diff                 | 24         |
| Precision          | 0.27%       |
| Recall             | 5.84%       |
| False Alarm Rate   | -0.40%      |
| F1-Score           | 3.25%       |
| Threat Score       | 4.53%       |


# Increase in Performance Across CV Metrics(Relative to WRN)
| Metric             | Improvement |
|--------------------|-------------|
| AUC                | 1.10%       |
| AUCPR              | 3.30%       |


### ‚úÖ Version 7 ‚Äì Textbook Wide ResNet w/ PReLU
- 1.29 MB
- Even better performance-to-size ratio.
- Tuned with Binary Cross-Entropy + Adam + Warmup CosineDecayRestart.
- Utilizes Proper Wide Resnet implementation for more dynamic and lightweight prediction
- Tuned attention dropout, regular dropout, label smoothing, and learning rate
- I already knew that the Wide Residual Network was incorrectly implemented on my end, but it still performed worse overall since the tunable parameters were optimized to my specific implementation
- I also replaced ReLU with PReLU as the activation function before the output layer. Unlike ReLU, PReLU learns the optimal slope for negative inputs during training, allowing the network to adaptively control the flow of negative signals and potentially achieve better performance. This is good but it is expensive, so only use it in key places.

### üîÄ Ensemble score across five folds
- Simple average ensemble of the five folds with different initialization seeds fold 1 with 98 fold 2 with 97 fold 3 with 96 fold 4 with 95 and fold 5 with 99.
- We do see a marginal 1 point increase on AUC and AUCPR relative to just fold 5, but most of the other metrics are indifferent. May or May not be worth it.

- PReLU along with architectural changes

Ensemble models consistently outperform the [baseline](https://huggingface.co/tornet-ml/tornado_detector_baseline_v1) on all major metrics.
