Based off of the assumption that a gating mechanism, one where
sending easier to classify examples one way and harder ones down a different 
path would work better. This was largely because while there were easier to
classify tornadoes within the dataset, there were also harder ones that
the model failed to properly quantify, one that needed deeper layers.
